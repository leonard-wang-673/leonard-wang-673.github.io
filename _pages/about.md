### About me

Hello, I am Wang Liang, and you can call me Leonard. I am a third-year undergraduate student at  [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/en/),[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I have excellent [academic performance](../_pages/portfolio.html) and have a deep passion for theoretical physics. My interests span a variety of fields, including hep-th, gr-qc, and qi-qc, and I aspire to pursue research in these areas during my PhD and throughout my career.

During the summer schools, I gained extensive knowledge of the latest developments in hep-th. I attended two summer schools at Southeast University [SEU Summer School](../assets/SEU%202023+2024%20Topics.pdf), where I delved into advanced theoretical physics concepts. My summer research projects introduced me to string theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. I am particularly fascinated by cosmology and inflation, having studied topics such as inflation, cosmological perturbations, and the cosmological bootstrap. [Refer to my study notes](../_pages/teaching.html).

Although my research career started relatively late, with professors assigning mostly [reading and learning tasks](../_pages/publications.html), my first formal research experience began this summer. I am currently working on twistor operator correlations on orbifolds in <p>AdS<sub>3</sub>/CFT<sub>2</sub></p> under the guidance of [Professor Cheng Peng ](https://kits.ucas.ac.cn/index.php/people/faculty/44-faculty/195-faculty-pengcheng) and doing research with [Professor Kai Yan](https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/en/jsml/yankai.html) studying Higer Loop Amplitudes in ABJM theory.
