During my undergraduate studies at **SJTU**(Shanghai Jiao Tong University), I demonstrated strong academic performance, which provided me with the opportunity to study abroad as an exchange student at **UNSW** (The University of New South Wales), ranked 19th in the QS World University Rankings, for one semester. Additionally, I participated in a six-week summer research program FuSEP(Future Scientist Exchange Program) at **USTC**(University of Science and Technology of China). These experiences significantly enhanced both my academic profile and my research skills.

My academic performance is partially displayed as follows:
