# Academic Experience
During my undergraduate studies at <span style="color:red">**SJTU**(Shanghai Jiao Tong University)</span>,  I demonstrated strong academic performance, which provided me with the opportunity to study abroad as an exchange student at <span style="color:green">**UNSW** (The University of New South Wales)</span> for one semester. Additionally, I participated Future Scientist Exchange Program at <span style="color:blue">**USTC**(University of Science and Technology of China)</span> as a six-week summer research program. These experiences significantly enhanced both my academic profile and my research skills.




# Grades

My academic performance is partially displayed as follows:

## Personal Statement
During my first year at SJTU, I faced challenges adapting to the academic environment and dealing with pandemic-related restrictions. Despite initial setbacks and grade inflation in parallel classes, my academic performance steadily improved. I took additional mathematics courses and enrolled in **General Relativity**, while also auditing **Gauge Field Theory**, only reserved for graduate students. I further enhanced my understanding of theoretical physics through self-study and participation in the **Southeast University Summer School on String Theory, Field Theory, and Holography**. 

I demonstrate strong self-learning abilities and a deep passion for theoretical physics beyond my coursework. To learn more about me, see my [notes](teaching.html).
