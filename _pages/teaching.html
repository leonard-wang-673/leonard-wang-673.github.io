<p>Through lecture notes, YouTube videos, and discussions with teachers, I have gained a basic understanding of many cutting-edge topics in physics.The following links contain <strong>mixed handwritten notes in both Chinese and English</strong>, which <strong>serve as a showcase</strong> of the topics I have explored. The corresponding LaTeX documents are still being organized and will be updated gradually.</p>





<h2>Cosmology</h2>
<p>
  I've learned classical cosmology through baumann's cosmology lecture and lecture-note on Inflation given in TASI  supplemented by David Tong's cosmology notes. I integrated these insights into a note.
</p>
<p>
  I studied professor Pajer's lecture note on cosmological field theroy and professor Xianyu's video class held in SEU 2022 and some video on youtube, to gain some understanding on cosmological collider theory.
</p>
<p>
  Recently I am interested in cosmological collider and cosmological bootstrap, I am learning Baumann's approach and Xianyu's approach of cosmology bootstrap.

<h2>String Theory</h2>
<p>
  Initial exploration includes the Nambu-Goto action, Polyakov action, gauge fixing, three quantization schemes, introducing supersymmetry, charge, and branes.
